## Story
**October 8, 2023** | Old friends and new friends ventured into the north to hike what was reputed a fairly challenging route which resembled Sibuyan Island's Mt. Guiting-Guiting. Although most have read about its mystique, only two have actually been through the mountain. Some expectations were met; Some were not; Some were exceeded. The series of raw images that follow highlight our journey to, in, and fro Arayat Traverse.

**0400** First thing we do after arriving was to order some actual grub and coffee. We also ended up watching some of Bea's old commercials.

**0451** Listening to a podcast about a man's internal battles, and how a friendship was rekindled by fate. This is one way to start a hike for sure.

**0549** Nothing lightens up the mood more than a cute puppy. It's almost as if we've forgotten about Lenny.
